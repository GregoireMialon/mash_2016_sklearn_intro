This repository was forked from *[Fabian Pedregosa](http://fa.bianp.net)*'s repository which contains notebooks and other files associated with the MASH course Projets Informatiques.

## Installation Notes
This tutorial requires Jupyter Notebook. The easiest way to get this is to use the [conda](https://store.continuum.io/) environment manager. I suggest downloading and installing [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html). Once this is installed, the following command will install all required packages in your Python environment:
```
$ conda install jupyter
```

Alternatively, you can download and install the (very large) Anaconda software distribution, found at https://store.continuum.io/.

## Downloading the Tutorial Materials
I would highly recommend using git, not only for this tutorial, but for the
general betterment of your life.  Once git is installed, you can clone the
material in this tutorial by using the git address shown above:

    git clone https://github.com/GregoireMialon/mash_sklearn_intro.git

If you can't or don't want to install git, there is a link above to download
the contents of this repository as a zip file.  I may make minor changes to
the repository in the days before the tutorial, however, so cloning the
repository is a much better option.
